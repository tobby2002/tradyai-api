### Usage

This is a submodule of japonicus. This takes care of on-the-fly strategy creation and management.
Its on a very beta stage, like the rest of this GA implementation.

### TODO:

The method is to just sum indicators, I.E to buy, all indicators should be above threshold.
That can work, but more complex interactions between indicators should be implemented.

### Disclaimer:

stratego? japonicus? promoterz? from which depth of hell do those names come? hehehe
